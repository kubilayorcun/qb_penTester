Option[1]:
-> Will prompt the user to enter the IP range to scan for that particular network.
-> Lower and upper IP limits should be provided in order to perform a proper scan.
-> e.g: 
Lower Limit : 192.168.1.10
Upper Limit : 192.168.1.60
[!] Be careful giving ip ranges, only last octet of the address should be representing the range.

Option[2]:
-> Will first look for alive hosts by using icmp requests and prompt the user with result for each IP that is scanned.
-> Then it will give the user to scan for particular protocols as: 
	--> 1)TCP 2)UDP 3)TCP && UDP
	--> After protocol choice program will prompt the user the provide upper and lower port limits to scan.
	--> [!] Ports can not smaller than 1 or bigger than 65535 so largest range is 1...65535
-> After port scan completed results will be appended to logFiles_qb/ports.dat as port/protocol/state/service/IP

Option[3]:
-> Will first look for alive hosts by using icmp requests and prompt the user with result for each IP that is scanned.
-> Then this option will scan the each host for open ports traversing through each protocol.
-> Finally, this task will save the output to /logFiles_qb/open_ports.dat

Option[4]:
-> Will first look for alive hosts by using icmp requests and prompt the user with result for each IP that is scanned. 
-> Then it will run operating system detection scan on those alive hosts that are scanned before.
-> After scan completed results will be written to logFiles_qb/OS_scan.dat file as seperated with line breaks for each IP.

Option[5]:
-> Not available yet, stay foolish stay hungry for upcoming updates.

Option[6]:-> This option will first ask the user for domain name inputs to scan.
--> Inputs can be given as:
	abc.com airline.com yumyum.org foobar.net
	[!] User shouldn't forget to give spaces between domain names otherwise line will be converted as one domain which will cause an error.
-> Then program will resolve IP addresses of given DNS'es.
-> The result will consist of os_types,os_version,resolved_ip's,open_ports and more. 
-> Scan results will be written to logFiles_qb/web.dat.

Option[7]:
-> This option will look for the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) having hosts.
-> Hosts to look for SNMP will be fetched from icmp ping search results. (liveHosts.txt)
-> Scan results will be written to logFiles_qb/snmp.dat

Option[8]:
-> This option will launch an SYN flood attack. 
	--> If you want to learn more about SYN flood attacks, visit https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/
-> After option picked program will ask for a specific ip as a target.
	[!] Full ip address should be provided.
-> After ip specification program ask for port range (like in option_2), example: 
	--> Lower port limit: 22 
	--> Upper port limit: 160
[!] However it is advised to give open ports to program in order to have a better attack.

Option[9]:
-> This option will list all the files that are so far created. 
-> After presenting the list of files, user can specify a file to observe the contents.
	--> To pick a file simpy write it's name.
-> After picking the file contents of the file will be shown with the line numbers.

Option[10]:
-> Will ask the user for a host in network.
-> Then it will ask the user for scan options one by one;
	--> Network scan (eg 192.168.1.0/24) or Host scan (eg 192.168.1.102)
	--> Port Range:
		--> User can provide a port range between 1-65535
		--> Also user can input '0' if does not want to specify a range.
	--> Protocol:
		--> User can sniff either TCP or UDP protocols packets.
[!] Use CTRL + C to finish the sniffer.
